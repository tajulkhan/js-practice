// 1. What is an array in JavaScript? How do you declare an array?
// An array in JavaScript is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable. 
// Arrays can hold values of any data type, and each value is accessed using an index, with the first index being 0.
// Declaring an array with three elements
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

// 2. How do you access the elements of an array?
// Elements in an array are accessed using their index. The index of the first element is 0, the second element is 1, and so on.
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
console.log(fruits[0]);
console.log(fruits[1]);
console.log(fruits[2]);
